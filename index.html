            <div class="paragraph"><p class="bio">My name is <span class="my-name">Faith Masiello</span> and I am a 21 year old senior in the VCD program at EWU. My goal is to graduate in the spring of 2017, and I hope everything works out the way it should! I love nature photography, and I am a part of many fandoms, some of which include Supernatural, Doctor Who, Sherlock (BBC), and many more. I can be nerdy at times (hence all the fandoms) and that's okay. I'm also shy and introverted, which I'm learning to embrace. I also love to read, write, and listen to music. I collect shot glasses and I think I have over 100 by now. I have a 16 year old mutt named Nellie and she's all black, but when the sun hits her just right, you can see brown swirls. I'm a huge Netflix binge watcher; the shows I've recently seen include Lost Girl, Blue Bloods, Royal Pains, and Haven. In the near future, I hope to use my photography skills to do freelance nature shots, or sell my own photos, either as single prints or in calendar format.</p>
