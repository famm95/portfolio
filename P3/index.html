            <h3>Project 3: Propoganda Poster</h3>
                <p class="description-3">During my first few weeks of the new 2016-2017 school year, I got assigned my very first project of VCD 3 class for fall quarter. Our goal was to think of a few different topics and figure out why we agreed or disagreed with those topics. When we finally narrowed down to only one topic, we had to design a propoganda poster that countered what the topic presented. I chose the harmful effects of pornography and the fact that it's so prevelant in today's tech age, that it's being called a 'new drug' by some scientists. I focused mostly on the idea that people claim to be Anti-Rape and Pro-Porn all at the same time. I think that is dangerous thinking, so this is how I went about making the propoganda poster.</p>
